# Validating bikeability indices of NetAScore

This repository contains code to sample Mapillary streetview imagery for validation of the bikeability index computed by [NetAScore](https://github.com/plus-mobilitylab/netascore). In an online survey participants will be asked to rate the sampled images in terms of bikeability. Their ratings will be compared to the bikeability index of NetASCore for the street segment captured by the image.
